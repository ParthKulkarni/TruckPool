Introduction

This project was implemented as a part of SE(Comp Engg) coursework at PICT, Pune under the guidance of Mr. Parag Jambhulkar.

Truck Pooling is an Android Application designed for user to provide an efficient and cost-effective way for the transportation of logistics through sharing of unoccupied volume in a truck. The application provides facility for the administrator, who owns a logistics company, to create trips between cities and specify the space available for sharing. The administrator has the liberty to decide the rate of the truck’s shared volume. The user of the application can request for a trip, specified by the date of delivery of goods and the weight of the commodity to be transported. All the trips matching the user’s requirements will be displayed to the user. The user will select the trip of his choice on which he/she will be able to book the shared space of the selected truck. The application also provides facility for the user to track his commodity according to the updates made by the respective administrator.

The process flow is implemented as follows:

	1. The administrator/customer of the application registers to the application. Here, the type of user(administrator/customer) can be specified.
	2. The user logs in to the application using e-mail address and password. The user is presented with the administrator/customer application based on the user	type provided at the time of registration.
	3. If user is administrator, he/she has the options to create a new trip, view ongoing trips and update the status of a trip.
	4. If user is customer,  he/she has the options to request for a trip, view booked trips and status, and view his/her account information.
	5. The user can choose to log out of the application. If not, the application will remember the account details the next time the user chooses to use the application.
